Using this playbook requires:
  - ansible-galaxy collection install google.cloud
  - ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.posix

To run a full provisioning (creates all VMs, installs docker, monitoring tools & deploys a stack):
  - ANSIBLE_CONFIG=ansible.cfg ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags "provision"

To delete the VMs after testing that this does indeed work:
  - ANSIBLE_CONFIG=ansible.cfg ansible-playbook playbook.yml --tags "delete-vms"
